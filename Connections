L298n motor driver:

+12V → Lipo battery (+)

GND → Lipo battery (- ) important: connect the GND to lipo battery (-) and to arduino board any GND pin

+5V → arduino Vin

In1 → arduino digital pin 7

In2 → arduino digital pin 6

In3 → arduino digital pin 5

In4 → arduino digital pin 4

OUT1 → Motor 1

OUT2 → Motor 1

OUT3 → Motor 2

OUT4 → Motor 2

Breadboard:

Connect two jumper wires to arduino board 5V and GND pins, then connect both wires to breadboard. now you can use this as +5V supply.

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sonar sensor:

VCC → breadboard +5V

Trig → arduino analog pin 1

Echo → arduino analog pin 2

GND → breadboard GND
